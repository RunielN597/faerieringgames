A tile-laying game for 2 players

## Components

- 20 Land Tiles; 5 of each type
- 8 Faerie Cubes

There's 10 with only 1 triangle of each of the two colors on them and 3 of the other, and 10 with 2 of each, which are further divided into "split" tiles and "cross" tiles.
 
## Goal

Have more points than the opponent when the game ends.

## Setup

Shuffle the 20 land tiles and deal 3 in the center of the table face down.

Set the rest of the tiles in a draw stack next to the 3 central tiles.

Set the 8 Faerie Cubes next to the 3 central tiles.

Decide randomly who goes first.

On your turn you may look at a face-down tile then:

-Look at a face-down tile, then add it and all Faerie Cubes on it to your tableau. Then, replace the tile with one from the draw stack.

- Look at a face-down tile, then put it back if it has no Faerie Cubes on it.   
- Add it and all Faerie Cubes on it to your tableau.
- Put it back.
- Put it back and add a Faeire Cube to it.

### Building your tableau

All tiles in your tableau must connect along like-colored edges.

When adding a tile with Faerie Cubes on it to your tableau, you must place all Faerie Cubes onto a section of colored land, and once placed, they can't be moved.

## Game End

The game ends when the final tile is placed in a player's tableau. Scoring then takes place.

## Scoring

A complete section of land is defined as one with no free edges, and can be made entirely of diamonds.

For each diamond in a complete section, the player receives one point.

For each Faerie Cube in a complete section, the player receives one point.

Whoever has more points wins! In case of a tie, whoever has fewer Faerie Cubes in their tableau wins. If this is still a tie, the younger player wins.
