Bluffs 

A tile-laying game for 2 players

Components:

- 20 Land Tiles; 5 of each type
- 8 Faerie Cubes

Goal: Have more points than the opponent when the game ends. 

Setup: Shuffle the 20 land tiles and deal 3 in the center of the table face down. 

Set the rest of the tiles in a draw stack next to the 3 central tiles.

Set the 8 Faerie Cubes next to the 3 central tiles.

Decide randomly who goes first. 

On your turn you may:

-Look at a face-down tile, then add it and all Faerie Cubes on it to your tableau.

-Look at a face-down tile, then put it back. 

-Look at a face-down tile, then put it back and add a Faeire Cube to it. 

Building your tableau: 

All tiles in your tableau must connect along like-colored edges. 

When adding a tile with Faerie Cubes on it to your tableau, you must place all Faerie Cubes onto a section of colored land, and once placed, they can't be moved.

Game end:

The game ends when the final tile is placed in a player's tableau. Scoring then takes place.

Scoring:

A complete section of land is defined as one with no free edges, and can be made entirely of diamonds. 

For each diamond in a complete section, the player receives one point. 

For each Faerie Cube in a complete section, the player receives one point. 

Whoever has more points wins! In case of a tie, whoever has fewer Faerie Cubes in their tableau wins. If this is still a tie, the younger player wins.
