Archdruid is a dice-rolling battle game for 2-4 players. Players are druids who conjure the elements of air, fire, water, earth, light, and darkness. Each druid can learn powerful spells, call animals to their aid, and make sacrifices to bend the outcome in their favor and hinder their opponents. Do you have the Willpower, Wisdom, Empathy - and most of all, luck - to defeat your rival druids and become the one and only Archdruid?
