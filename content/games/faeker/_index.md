Ask me later, but I fell asleep again, have been up for a bit, and made a little bluffing card game that only uses 32 cards and a supply of 33 cubes.  I call it Fae-ker.

I typed the rules in a text document, but have been having trouble getting it to markdown. But I'll save that for later. Going back to bed now.
