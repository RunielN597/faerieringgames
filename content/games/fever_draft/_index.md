title: Fever Draft
---

Had a dream about larp and Magic, but when I woke up, I had an idea for a card game that only uses up to 6 standard card decks. It's a drafting card game where 2-6 players each build their unique deck of cards, then play something akin to a combination of poker, Balatro, and/or a bit of Keyforge. You're trying to make 3 big poker hands from a hand of 7-9 cards, called "jokers", and the name of the game for now is either Fever Draft (like a fever dream) or 3 Jokers Draft...or perhaps 3 Jokers Fever.  I also want to incorporate the theme of seasons, like the original deck of cards does. But I could make the rules as a PnP, and it's up to the players to get the cards.  Back to bed. Night.
