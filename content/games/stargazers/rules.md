A microgame for 2 players. 

**Components**:

- 18 cards, numbered from 1-9 in suns and moons.
- 12 meeples, 6 light and 6 dark.

**Setup**:

Choose a start player. Give each player their 6 meeples.

Shuffle the deck of cards, and deal 3 cards to each player.

Flip the top card of the deck over to form the start of the grid. 

On your turn, you must play a card to the grid in an orthogonal space. 

Then, you may place meeples on the cards in the row or column of the card you just played. 

**Scoring**:

If two cards lie next to each other (including diagonals) and their total is 9-11, you score a point. 

Note you may score multiple points in a turn this way. 

If two cards have the same rank and they both have meeples on them, draw the shortest orthogonal path you can that connects two meeples, and you score one point for each card in the path. 

After playing a card and meeples, draw a card. 

The game ends when the last card is played from a hand. 

Tally up the points, and whoever has more wins. 

In case of a tie, whoever has the highest card with a meeple on it wins. If there is still a tie, check the next highest card, and so on until a winner is determined.
