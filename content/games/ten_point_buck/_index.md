title: Ten Point Buck
---
10-Point Buck is a trick-taking game for 3-4 players. Using a specialized deck of cards with one 10-point Buck, two 9s, three 8s, all the way down to 10 ones, players predict how many points worth of animals they can take in the round of play. But watch out - for even the lower-ranking Doe can trump the Buck!
