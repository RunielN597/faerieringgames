title: Ten-Point Buck Rules
---

A Trick-Taking Game for Three to Five Players

## Components

- 56 cards, including ten 1s, nine 2s, eight 3s, and so on, down to one 10-point card, the Buck, and also one 0, the Doe.
- A writing utensil and paper, to keep track of bids and Hunting Points.

## Object

Score more Hunting Points than anyone else after 5 rounds by winning tricks and getting as close to your bid as possible. 

## Setup

Shuffle the deck of cards, and deal ten cards to each player. Set the rest of the cards aside. Note that whoever is dealer changes each round, proceeding clockwise.

## Bidding

After dealing, the player to the dealer's left places a bid.

Players are bidding how many points they think they will be able to take during the tricks played in the round. A bid can be any whole positive number or zero, but players are trying to get as close to possible to their bid, ideally making their exact bid.

After each player places a bid, play begins with the lead going to the player on the dealer's left.

## Tricks

The leading player plays a card to the table, and then the next player, and so on until each player has played a card. One copy of each card in a rank is colored white; these are the trump cards. Whoever plays the highest card of the trump suit wins the trick, and if a trick contains no trump cards, whoever played the highest normal card wins the trick; the winner gathers all the cards played to their score pile. If there is a tie, whoever played the first card of the highest rank played wins the trick. Then whoever won the trick takes the lead for the next trick.

## Legal Plays

A player may not choose to play a card to the trick if there is already a card of that rank in the trick, unless it is their only available option.

## The Doe

The Doe card is normally worth zero when playing to a trick; however, if the Doe and the Ten-Point Buck are played to the same trick, then the Doe card wins the trick. The player who won this trick also immediately scores 2 Hunting Points.

## Scoring

After all ten tricks in a round have been played, players count how many points of cards they have in their score pile, then compares that to their bids. How close a player is to their bid determines how many Hunting Points they receive:

**Exact Bid**: 10 Hunting Points

**1-5 Points Away**: 5 Hunting Points

**6-10 Points Away**: 3 Hunting Points

**11-15 Points Away**: 2 Hunting Points

**16+ Points Away**: 0 Hunting Points

## End of Game

After 5 rounds of play, whoever has the most Hunting Points wins. If there is a tie, additional rounds are played until the tie is broken.
