## Components

- 10 Druid Meeples (5 Light and 5 Dark)
- 3 Magic Circle Tokens
- 20 Energy Cubes (10 Light and 10 Dark)
- 4 dice (2 Light and 2 Dark)

## Object

- Control At least 2 of the 3 Magic Circle Tokens at the same time.

### Setup

Set the three Magic Circle Tokens in a triangle in the center of the play area, spaced far apart. 

Lay down the 10 meeples in the center of the triangle, called "The Grove".

Give each player their supply of 10 Energy Cubes.

Determine who goes first by each player rolling their 2 dice. The player with the highest total goes first.


### Play Area

The center of the triangle is called "The Grove." It is where meeples start the game. 

From The Grove, meeples will move to the Magic Circle Tokens. 

Then, they attempt to channel Energy Cubes onto the Tokens in an attempt to control them.

### REAL-TIME GAME! 

This game is a real-time game. There are no turns; each player rolls their dice and performs actions as fast as they are able to. 

Whenever a player rolls a 7, they may perform one of the following actions at either a Magic Circle or The Grove:

 - Stand
 - Move
 
 Whenever a player rolls a number on a die that is lower than the number of Druid Meeples present at a Magic Circle, they may: 
 - Channel
 - Stun
 
 Whenever a player rolls 6-6 or 1-1, they may:
 - Banish


### Actions in Detail

###  Stand

 **Stand a meeple up.**

To do this, check what the results of your dice are. If they show 7, you may perform this action.

If this action was taken at The Grove, you may immediately take a second action, including standing again.  However, only two actions may ever be taken this way.

### Move 

To do this, check what the results of your dice are. If they show 7, you may perform this action.

Move **some or all** standing meeples from either The Grove to a Magic Circle, or all standing meeples from a Magic Circle to another one.

### Channel

Attempt to channel at a Magic Circle. 

To do this, check what the results of your dice are. 

Each result **equal to or lower than the number of standing Druids of your color on that Magic Circle** is a success.

For each success, place a cube of your color on the Magic Circle.

Note, a Magic Circle may only contain 5 cubes on it. **If there are cubes of both colors at a Magic Circle and one cannot be placed**, remove one cube of the opponent's color and return it to the player's supply until there are only cubes of one color on the Magic Circle.

###  Stun

Attempt to stun the opponent's meeples. 

 To do this, check what the results of your dice are.

 Each result **equal to or lower than the number of standing Druids of your color present at that Magic Circle** is a success. 

 However, **you may only count a number of successes equal to the number of standing Druids you have present at the Magic Circle you are performing this action.** 

 **Note you may not Stun at The Grove.**

 For each success, lay a meeple of your opponent's color at the same Magic Circle down.

###  Banish

Banish the opponent's meeples from a Magic Circle back to The Grove, lying down.

 To do this, check what the results of your dice are. 

 **If your dice show 6-6 or 1-1, you banish.**

Move all the opponent's meeples from the Magic Circle where you are performing this Action back to The Grove, laying down.



### Controlling a Magic Circle

 When you have 3 cubes of your color on a Magic Circle, you are said to control it. 
- Note you may lose control of a Magic Circle through your opponent Channeling.
- If you ever control two of the three Magic Circles, you win!
