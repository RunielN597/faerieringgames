## Components

- 12 Druid Meeples (6 Light and 6 Dark)
- 3 Magic Circle Tokens
- 40 Energy Cubes (20 Light and 20 Dark)
- 6 dice (3 Light and 3 Dark)

## Object

- Control at least 2 of the 3 Magic Circle Tokens when your turn starts.

### Setup

Set the three Magic Circle Tokens in a triangle in the center of the play area, spaced far apart. 

Lay down the 12 meeples in the center of the triangle.

Give each player their supply of 20 Energy Cubes.

Determine who goes first by each player rolling their 3 dice. The player with the highest total goes first.


### Play Area

The center of the triangle is called "The Grove." It is where meeples start the game. 

From The Grove, meeples will move to the Magic Circle Tokens. 

Then, they attempt to channel Energy Cubes onto the Tokens in an attempt to control them.

### On your turn:

1. Check and see if you win by controlling 2 of 3 Magic Circles.

2. Perform one of the following actions at either a Magic Circle or The Grove:

 - Stand
 - Move
 - Channel
 - Stun
 - Banish


### Actions in Detail

###  Stand

 **Stand a meeple up.**

If this action was taken at The Grove, you may take a second action, including standing again.  However, only two actions may ever be taken in a turn this way.

### Move 

Move **all** standing meeples from either The Grove to a Magic Circle, or all standing meeples from a Magic Circle to another one.

### Channel

Attempt to channel at a Magic Circle. 

To do this, roll your three dice. 

Each result **equal to or lower than the number of standing Druids of your color on that Magic Circle** is a success.

For each success, place a cube of your color on the Magic Circle.

Then, if there are cubes of both colors at a Magic Circle, remove one cube of each color and return them to the players' supplies until there are only cubes of one color on the Magic Circle.

###  Stun

Attempt to stun the opponent's meeples. 

 To do this, roll your three dice.

 Each result **equal to or lower than the number of standing Druids of your color present at that Magic Circle** is a success. 

 However, **you may only count a number of successes equal to the number of standing Druids you have present at the Magic Circle you are performing this action.** 

 **Note you may not Stun at The Grove.**

 For each success, lay a meeple of your opponent's color at the same Magic Circle down.

###  Banish

Attempt to banish the opponent's meeples from a Magic Circle back to The Grove, lying down.

 To do this, roll your three dice. 

 **Each 6 is a success.**

 For each success, move an opponent's meeple from the Magic Circle where you are performing this Action back to The Grove, laying down.


Once you perform an action, the turn passes back to the opponent.

### Controlling a Magic Circle

 When you have 7 cubes of your color on a Magic Circle, you are said to control it. 
- Note you may lose control of a Magic Circle through your opponent Channeling.
- If, at the start of your turn, you control two of the three Magic Circles, you win!
