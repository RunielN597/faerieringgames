title: mint druids

a tiny worker-placement game? 

Like Mint Works, kinda, but with the druid theme? 

It could use little half-size cards with natural resources or elements on them like water, wood, and fire for spells, for instance, and meeples as the workers. 

But you would only use one die and 6 workers. And I could reuse the dice mechanic from Battle for the Grove, you have a better chance of collecting that resource the more workers you put on it.

Only 3 players max - white, grey, and black. But the cards would be resources players take, so we wouldn't have to include physical components. 18 meeples, 3 dice, and a half-deck of cards. That should be it.

Oh, maybe four elements: water, fire, wood, water, and mint to represent the herbs.

Dude...what if I made a game that was just one sheet of mini cards? 21 cards.

Okay, so, this could reeimpliment the Elementiles idea. The cards are like dominos. You're trying to make connections of big patches of 3 elements. Maybe add a single meeple just in case. Hm...wait, no...
