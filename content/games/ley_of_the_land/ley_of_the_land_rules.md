### Object: Have the most points when the game ends. 

### Setup:

Give each player a Player Board, and 10 Money Cubes.  

Shuffle all of the land tiles, and place them in the lid of the box face down.

Place the Market Board in the center of the table, and deal 5 tiles at random to the 5 slots in the Market Board. 

Each round of play is broken into several phases. 

- Simultaneous Bidding Phase
- Action Phase 

### 1. Simultaneous Bidding Phase
Players simultaneously bid Money Cubes to take an action later in the turn. 

You may bid an amount up to and including the number of Money Cubes you have, or zero, but never more than the number of Money Cubes you have.

Bidding happens in secret. Place your bid inside your fist, then all bids are revealed simultaneously. 

If there is ever a tie, it is resolved by going clockwise around the tbale, starting with whoever currently has the Tiebreaker Marker. 

After bidding is complete, players return all Money Cubes bid to the supply.

### 2. Action Phase:

Starting with the high bidder, each player may choose to either:

 - Acquire a land tile from the market
 - Frolick
 - Sow
 - Reap
 - Invest
 
 Once a player has chosen to take an action other than Acquire a Tile, no other player may do the same action that turn. 
 
### Acquire a land tile:
Take a land tile from the market and place it in the center space of your player board (if it is empty), or connected to at least one other tile. 

**NOTE: all tiles must be placed along like colored edges, or the edge of the board.**

If this completes a section of land, ie, closes a shape on either the edge of the board or on its own...

The player receives an amount of Faerie Cubes equal to the number of green diamonds formed by their shape, with excess triangles not counting.

The player receives an amount of Wheat Cubes equal to the number of yellow diamonds formed by their shape, with excess triangles not counting.

Frolick: Place a Faeire Cube on each complete green section of land you own, then take a Money Cube from the supply for each Faerie Cube you just placed. 

Sow: Place a Wheat Cube on each complete yellow section of land you own.

Reap: Remove a Wheat Cube from a single section of land you own, return it to the supply, then take 3 Money Cubes from the supply. 

**NOTE: A section of land may only hold a number of cubes equal to or less than the number of diamonds in its shape.**

Invest: If this is the last player to take an action this round, double the number of Money Cubes spent on taking this action, and return them to the player. Otherwise, return the Money Cubes to the supply. 


### End of game:

The game ends when one player fills up their board with tiles, or the tile stock runs out. Finish the current turn, then count the score for each player.  

Each player's score is equal to...

- One point for every Money Cube they possess. 
- One point for each Faerie or Wheat Cube they possess.
- A bonus of 12 points for having the largest continuous section of land, counted by the number of triangles. If there is a tie for this reward, each player shares the points evenly. 

Whoever has the most points wins. 

In event of a tie, whoever had the largest continuous section of land wins. 

If there is still a tie, whoever has the most Faerie Cubes unused wins, then whoever has the most Wheat Cubes, then whoever has the most Money Cubes, and if there is still a tie, the players share victory.
