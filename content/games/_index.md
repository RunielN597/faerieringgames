## Archdruid

Archdruid is a dice-rolling battle game for 2-4 players. Players are druids who conjure the elements of air, fire, water, earth, light, and darkness. Each druid can learn powerful spells, call animals to their aid, and make sacrifices to bend the outcome in their favor and hinder their opponents. Do you have the Willpower, Wisdom, Empathy - and most of all, luck - to defeat your rival druids and become the one and only Archdruid? 
 
## 10-Point buck

10-Point Buck is a trick-taking game for 3-4 players. Using a specialized deck of cards with one 10-point Buck, two 9s, three 8s, all the way down to 10 ones, players predict how many points worth of animals they can take in the round of play. But watch out - for even the lower-ranking Doe can trump the Buck!
