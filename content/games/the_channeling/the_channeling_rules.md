**A Game for Two Players**

**Components:** 30 Magic Circle  Cards, 24 Glyph Cards (3 sets of 8 cards), 4 Druid Tokens (2 in each color), 100 Light and Dark Energy Cubes (50 of each color)

**Object:** Have more Splendor than the opponent when the game ends.

**Setup:** Players choose randomly who will play as Light, and who as Dark. Give each player a set of 8 different Glyph Cards, the two Druid Tokens of their color, and the 50 Energy Cubes of their color. Shuffle the deck of Magic Circle Cards. Then, place a different Glyph Card in the four spaces below and to the right of the deck, using the remaining set of Glyph Cards. Draw 16 Magic Circle Cards, and place them below and to the right of the Glyph Cards, forming an inner grid. Place the four Druid Tokens on the four center cards of this grid, with tokens of each color diagonally across from each other. Play begins with Light.

**Turn Structure:** There are 4 steps to a turn, performed in order:

1. Play a Glyph Card
2. Move a Druid Token
3. Place and remove Energy Cubes on Magic Circle Cards in a Leyline Path
4. Acquire Magic Circle Cards for Splendor

Once a player completes the 4th step in their turn, play passes to the other player. 

**Magic Circle Cards:** Each Magic Circle Card has two values on the card. The value made of circles is the card’s Vigor value, and the value made of petals is the card's Splendor value. Each Magic Circle Card has a Vigor of four through seven, and varying Splendor.

**Leyline Path:** one of the shortest paths of Magic Circle Cards, starting with the Druid Token the player has just moved and ending with the other Druid Token, that only moves horizontally and vertically, and connects the player’s two Druid Tokens. A player may not draw a path that is longer than necessary, or draw the path diagonally. Note that when channeling Energy Cubes along a Leyline Path, the Magic Circle Cards with Druid Tokens will receive additional Energy Cubes.

**Overchanneling:** If a Magic Circle Card is acquired using more Energy Cubes than its Splendor value, the player keeps the excess cubes near the cards. Each cube subtracts one from the player’s score at the end of the game.

**Ending the Game:** Play continues until one player acquires at least seven Magic Circle Cards. This triggers the end of the game; the other player gets one additional turn, and then the game ends. Whoever has the most Splendor from acquiring Magic Circle Cards after taking into account Overchanneling wins the game, and in case of a tie, whoever acquired the fewest Magic Circle Cards wins the game. If there is still a tie, whoever went second wins.

### The Steps of a Turn in Detail

**Play a Glyph Card:** The player selects a Glyph Card from their hand and lays it in front of them on the table. If this is their eighth and final Glyph Card, the player then takes all of their Glyph Cards back into their hand for the next turn.

**Move a Druid Token:** The player then moves a Druid Token from one Magic Circle Card to a different Magic Circle Card in the row or column of cards indicated by the Glyph Card they just played, that does not contain another Druid Token, of either color.

**Place and remove Energy Cubes on Magic Circle Cards in a Leyline Path:** Starting with the Druid Token the player just moved and ending with the player's second Druid Token, the player places Energy Cubes on cards in a Leyline Path; . 

Then, the player removes Energy Cubes from the card if there are cubes of both colors on it; remove one Light and one Dark cube from the card, until there are only cubes of a single color remaining on the card. 

**Acquire Magic Circle Cards for Splendor:** Then, any Magic Circle Cards that have a number of cubes of that player’s color equal to or greater than its Vigor value are removed from the grid and placed in front of that player. The cards are then replaced in the order the acquiring player chooses, with cards from the deck. The player then places a number of Energy Cubes equal to the Magic Carcle Card's Splendor value back into their supply, keeping the rest for Overchanneling.
