The Channeling

A Game for Two Players

## Components

- 36 Magic Circle Cards
- 24 Glyph Cards (3 sets of 8 cards in Light, Dark, and Green)
- 4 Druid Tokens (2 of Light and Dark)
- 100 Energy Cubes (50 of Light and Dark)

## Object

Have more Splendor than the opponent when the game ends.

## Setup

Players choose randomly who will play as Light and who as Dark. 

Give each player: 

- One set of 8 different Glyph Cards of their color. This becomes their hand.
- Two Druid Tokens of their color.
- One set of 50 Energy Cubes of their color.

Shuffle the deck of Magic Circle Cards. Place this in the upper left hand corner of the play area.

Using the Green set of Glyph Cards, place a different Glyph Card in four spaces below and to the right of the deck of Magic Circle Cards.

Draw 16 Magic Circle Cards, and place them below and to the right of the Green Glyph Cards, forming an inner 4x4 grid.

Place the four Druid Tokens on the four center Magic Circle Cards of this grid, with Druid Tokens of each color diagonally across from each other.

Each player selects 3 Glyph Cards from their hand and lays them face-down on the table, ensuring the opponent doesn't see them.

## Turn Structure

Play begins with Light.

**Overview:** There are 6 steps to a turn, performed in order:

1.	Play a Glyph Card.
2.	Move a Druid Token.
3.	Place Energy Cubes on Magic Circle Cards along the chosen Leyline Path.
4.	Remove Energy Cubes on Magic Circle Cards along the chosen Leyline Path.
5.	Acquire Magic Circle Cards for Splendor.
6.	Check for Endgame.
   Once a player completes the 6th step in their turn, play passes to the other player. 

### 1 - Play a Glyph Card

The player selects a Glyph Card from their hand and lays it in front of them on the table. If this is their final Glyph Card, the player takes all of their Glyph Cards back into their hand for the next turn. At the beginning of that turn, the player selects 3 Glyph Cards and lays them face-down on the table, ensuring the opponent doesn't see them.

### 2 - Move a Druid Token

The player moves one Druid Token from one Magic Circle Card to a different Magic Circle Card in the row or column of cards indicated by the Glyph Card they just played that does not contain a Druid Token.

### 3 - Place Energy Cubes on Magic Circle Cards along a Leyline Path

Starting with the Druid Token the player just moved and ending with the player’s second Druid Token, the player places Energy Cubes on cards along the Leyline Path for this turn. 

- 3 Cubes are placed on the Magic Circle Card that has the Druid Token that moved this turn.
- 2 Cubes are placed on the Magic Circle Card with the Druid Token that was stationary this turn. 
- 1 Cube is placed on each additional Magic Circle Card along the chosen Leyline Path.

### 4 - Remove Energy Cubes on Magic Circle Cards along the chosen Leyline Path

The player removes Energy Cubes from a Magic Circle Card if there are Energy Cubes of both colors on it. Remove one Light and one Dark Energy Cube from the card, repeating the process until there are only Energy Cubes of a single color remaining on the card.

### 5 - Acquire Magic Circle Cards for Splendor

Any Magic Circle Cards that have a number of Energy Cubes of that player’s color equal to or greater than its Vigor value are removed from the grid and placed in front of that player.
The cards are then replaced in the order the acquiring player chooses, with cards from the Magic Circle Card Deck.
The player then places a number of Energy Cubes equal to the Magic Carcle Card’s Vigor value back into their supply, keeping the rest as Overchanneling Cubes.

### 6 - Check for Endgame

Play continues until one player acquires at least seven Magic Circle Cards. This triggers the end of the game; the other player gets one additional turn, and then the game ends. Whoever has the most Splendor from acquiring Magic Circle Cards after taking into account Overchanneling Cubes wins the game.
In case of a tie…

- Whoever acquired the fewest Magic Circle Cards wins 
- If there is still a tie, whoever went second wins.

## Game Terms

**Glyph Cards:** The 8 green cards used to mark the outside of the 4 x 4 grid of Magic Circle Cards, and the cards of each player’s color that comprise their hand that they use to move their Druid Tokens across the grid.

**Leyline Path:** One of the shortest paths of Magic Circle Cards, starting with the Druid Token the player has just moved and ending with the stationary Druid Token. A Leyline Path… 

- Only moves horizontally and vertically, NOT diagonally.
- Connects the player’s two Druid Tokens. 
- Is the shortest path between two Druid Tokens. 

When channeling Energy Cubes along a Leyline Path, the Magic Circle Cards with Druid Tokens receive additional Energy Cubes, which may lead to Overchanneling.

**Magic Circle Cards:** Each Magic Circle Card has two values on the card. The value made of circles is the card’s Vigor value and the value made of petals is the card’s Splendor value. Each Magic Circle Card has a Vigor of four through seven, and Splendor of three through eight.

**Splendor(Inner Blue Pedals):** The number of victory points you get at the end of the game. Represented by blue inner petals on Magic Circle Cards and by Blue Numbers in the upper right hand and lower left hand corners of Magic Circle Cards.

**Vigor(Outside Yellow Circles)**: How many Energy Cubes must be on a Magic Circle Card at the end of the turn to acquire it. Represented by yellow outer circles on Magic Circle Cards and by yellow Numbers in the upper left hand and lower right hand corners of Magic Circle Cards.

**Energy Cubes:** Placed each turn after moving your Druid Token, and removed if both colors exist on a Magic Circle Card. Energy Cubes acquire Magic Circle Cards when there is a number of Energy Cubes on the Magic Circle Card equal to or greater than the Magic Circle Card's Vigor value, with excess Energy Cubes being kept as Overchanneling Cubes.

**Overchanneling Cubes:** When a Magic Circle Card is acquired using more Energy Cubes than its Vigor value, the player keeps the excess cubes near the Magic Circle Cards as Overchanneling Cubes. Each Overchanneling Cube reduces the players Splendor by one at the end of the game.
