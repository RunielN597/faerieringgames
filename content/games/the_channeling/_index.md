A game for two players. 

Players are druids channeling magical energy across leyline paths to acquire Magic Circles that lie in a grid.

The rules are simple… play a glyph card, move one of your druids, and channel energy in the shortest path between your two druids. But be careful not to overchannel the locations of the forest with energy! 
Whoever has more Splendor at the end of the game wins.
