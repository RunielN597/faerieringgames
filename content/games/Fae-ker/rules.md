- 3 players: 12
- 4 players: 10

Fae-ker is played in rounds. Each round, one player will earn fae cubes.

To set up a round, shuffle the deck and deal 5 cards to each player. Then, turn the top card of the deck over. Bidding starts with the player on dealer's left. 

If the top card is a number from 1-3, the players are bidding how many of their cards are higher than the top card. 

If the top card is a number from 4-7, the players are bidding how many of their cards are **equal to** or higher than the top card.

If the top card is a stone circle, the players are bidding how many of their cards are in sequence, 12, 234, etc.

Stone circle cards: these cards count as being equal to the top card, or as wild cards when used in a sequence.

During bidding a player may announce any number from 0-5, pass, call a showdown, or call a bluff. But, they do not have to tell the truth about the cards they hold. 

If a player bids and all other players pass, the player collects a number of fae cubes equal to the number of fae on the top card.

All numerical bids must be equal to or higher than previous bids. If two or more bids tie for highest, or a player calls a showdown, then the tie is broken by who has the highest cards in their hand (Example: a 6 beats a 5, and a 5 and 4 beat a 5 and 3, so on.) If there is still a tie, each player receives the fae cubes from the supply. 

If there ever aren't enough cubes in the supply to give, each player gets an equal share of as many cubes as possible.

If a player is called for a bluff, they reveal their hand. If they were telling the truth, they collect the cubes for the round immediately. If they were lying, the calling player collects the cubes, plus one extra for catching the player in a lie.
