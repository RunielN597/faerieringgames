title: Chalice and Wand
---

It's a 2-player cooperative game, and the only cards in the deck are silver chalices and oak wands with different values from 1 to 10 on them, say, 3 copies of each for a 60 card deck. 

You match cards of values together - so you can score a 1 and 2 chalice together with a 3 wand, for 6 points, or a 6 chalice and 6 wand together for  12 points, etc. 

The players each have two different hands of cards to play from, but they have to switch which hand to use for the round each time, while taking cards into those hands from the center.
