So, I talked to the runner of my local library today, as well as made a new friend through The Channeling.

My local library said they would be willing to promote the game. :)
So, thank you to Monongahela Area Library for all your help.

I also learned a couple of things about the game itself by playing today:

- Just because you made a game doesn't mean you're the best at it. I played a game today against a new player and lost by 5 points, which by my reckoning is basically a whole card I needed to catch up. But, I do have to say that I'm glad that I made a game that "anybody" can win, even a new player.  
- The second thing I discovered is that lower-scoring cards are the ones that tend to get scored the most in The Channeling. But who knows, maybe there's a playstyle where you can hold off your opponent and score the big cards.
