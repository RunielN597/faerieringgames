Here's a little thing I made. It's going to be in the next version of The Channeling rulebook:

Runiel stepped back. He could practically smell the darkness in the magic circle that lay before him.  He didn’t want to enter, not without taking proper precautions. 

Raising his arms in a gesture to the sacred earth, and, channeling energy through the leylines, he drew a glyph in the air, A’vena. The glyph materialized, forming a green sigil that hovered in the air. Then, Runiel pressed his left hand forward; the glyph flew away, and made contact with the circle’s barrier. As the glyph slammed into the surface, Runiel whispered a small spell: 

“For valor, for vigor, serenity and splendor, darkness present, truly be gone here!”

The energy of the circle shifted; Runiel could sense it along with a faint breeze that carried itself through the woods. Then, slowly, he stepped into the circle’s center, attuning himself to it. 

Yes…

He could feel the earth beneath his bare feet, and life, precious life, was again stirring in its depths. Alive, breathing, moving...as all things should be. "
