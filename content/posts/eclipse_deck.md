So, I just thought of a new card deck idea. I call it the Eclipse Deck. 

It's only 34 cards, with three suits of 11 cards, plus one extra card. 

The three suits are suns, moons, *and* sun and moon, together. 

What makes rhis deck unique, you may ask? Well, apart from being a shortened deck of cards, the cards have different numbers on them.

The sun and moon suits are numbered from 1-11...but the "eclipse" suit is numbered not only from 1-11, but 12-22. 

This means the value of the card can change depending on the rules of the game you're playing. 

The main idea I had for this value-changing mechanic was in a trick-taking game. This Eclipse Deck might replace Ten-Point Buck. 

When a card of the Eclipse suit is led, it acts as the higher value on the card. But when it's thrown offsuit, the lower value takes effect. 

I also am trying to think of another game to play with this deck. Two, in fact. 

One game is a press-your-luck card game, and the other is a game where you're trying to form "eclipses" for points.

For now, that's all I have to say with regards to this deck.
