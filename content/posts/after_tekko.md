So, I just got back from Tekko 2025, a local anime convention in the Pittsburgh area.
During the convention, I got to playtest The Channeling over 3 separate days. 
Two of the days were at the convention itself, and one day was at a Pittsburgh Playtest Event.

I wanted to quickly say, thank you to all of the people who playtested The Channeling during this past weekend, and thank you for all of the feedback I received.
The feedback inspired me to add a variant rule to the game: instead of the players having to handle a dwindling hand of cards, the players select 3 Glyphs to eliminate from their hand at the start of each set of turns. 
This way, the players have the opportunity to bluff and also play the same Glyphs faster. 
If the rule works out in playtesting, it may become the only way to play the game. 

During the convention, I met a designer named Shawn and we talked about manufacturing The Channeling and other games. He referred me to a couple of interesting companies, Delano and Whatz Games. 
Unfortunately, their minimum print runs are too much to produce the game with them at the moment, so I believe Faerie Ring Games is going to use Print Ninja for the first few copies, and once we can afford it, we'll try another company. 

Currently, we're trying to get the website updated, which is why you're seeing this blog post.

My friend Scott is working on a "premium box" to sell some copies of the game in. But they're going to be in short supply. Only about 5 or so. 
The rest of the games are going to be packaged in small cardboard boxes, about 8.5" x 5.5", to accomodate the rulebook.

After we finish the first small run of The Channeling, we may decide to finish the other designs mentionedd in the previous blog post. Battle for the Grove is simple in components, and Ten-Point-Buck is just a deck of cards.

Again, thank you to all of the playtesters from this past weekend. I really think The Channeling is going to be a success once we finish it. :)
