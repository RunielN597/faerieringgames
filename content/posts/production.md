title: Production - why we can't just use Amazon

So, after talking with Scott about getting The Channeling produced, I don't think we're going to be selling The Channeling on Amazon.

I originally wanted to sell the game in an online store like Amazon, or even a friendly LGS, but we'll have to see about that now.

The game itself is done, at least rules-wise. Not really any big changes that I could see making. 

But, instead, we might forego making a profit to get the game on store shelves, or possibly make a print-and-play version. We'll see.

There's a couple of events I want to demo the game at again, like the local library, and at my old college. But all things in good time.
