Alright. I just want to say, it's been a hard road that's taken 2 years to walk down, but we're finally getting things done here at Faerie Ring Games.  

Currently, all of our games have a nature theme. But if these games become popular, more will be on the way, possibly including other themes.

Our main game, The Channeling, will hopefully be ready to demo and possibly ship in a couple of months. No word on the price yet, but I'll do the math on that one day soon. 

The second game, Ten-Point Buck, is my take on a trick-taking card game. I absolutely adore trick-takers, like Euchre, Wizard, and Hearts. So, I figured, why not try and make my own version of one?

The game feels a little like Wizard or its cousin "Oh Hell!", but hopefully we'll differentiate it enough during testing to make it unique while still being fun. 

The final game we're trying to finish soon is called Bluffs. It's what could be considered a microgame, as there's only a few components in the box (by the way, all of our games, for now, are going to ship in the same nondescript brown box, with a simple label on it).

Bluffs is a miniaturized version of my first design, which is called Ley of the Land, and it's trying to pack a lot into a small package. It uses a subset of the tiles from that game, but notably only 20 of them, plus a few cubes. That's the entire game. 

Our plans are to finish as many of these games as possible in two months, and see if we can get demo copies printed. From there we can take the copies to locations like the local anime convention and gauge interest. 

I'm excited that we're finally nearing the finish line. Two years is a long time, and a lot has happened to me in these past two. 

But I just wanted to say, thank you to Scott and Ragnarr, along with anyone who's playtested these games so far. Without you all, I'd be nowhere. 

That's all for now. Peace, everyone.
